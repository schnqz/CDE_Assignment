## CoreDataEngineers ETL & Posey Analysis Project

### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
As a new Data Engineer at CoreDataEngineers, I was tasked with setting up a simple ETL pipeline, creating automation scripts, and performing SQL-based competitor analysis. The infrastructure runs on Linux, and all scripts were written in Bash with PostgreSQL for database operations.

The project includes:
A Bash ETL script to Extract, Transform, and Load data.
A Bash script to move JSON/CSV files into a dedicated directory.
A Bash script to download and load Parch & Posey competitor data into PostgreSQL.
SQL scripts to answer analytical questions about Parch & Poseyâ€™s business.
An ETL pipeline diagram to document the workflow.
